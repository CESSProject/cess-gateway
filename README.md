CESS-Gateway is a service that using REST API specification for accessing CESS cloud storage.


## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find out any system bugs or you have a better suggestions, Please send an email to frode@cess.one,
we are happy to communicate with you.


## System Requirements
- Linux-amd64


## Build from source

**Step 1:** Install common libraries

Take the ubuntu distribution as an example:

```shell
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install make gcc git curl wget vim util-linux -y
```

**Step 2:** Install go locale

CESS-Gateway requires [Go1.16.5](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher.
> See the [official Golang installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) If you get stuck in the following process.

- Download go1.16.5 compress the package and extract it to the /use/local directory:

```shell
sudo wget -c https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O - | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local
```

- You'll need to add `/usr/local/go/bin` to your path. For most Linux distributions you can run something like:

```shell
echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

- View your go version:

```shell
go version
```

**Step 3:** Build a gateway

```
git clone https://github.com/CESSProject/cess-gateway.git
cd cess-gateway/
go build -o gateway cmd/main.go
```
If all goes well, you will get a program called `gateway`.


## Get started with gateway

**Step 1:** Register a polka wallet

Browser access: [App](https://testnet-rpc.cess.cloud/explorer) implemented by [CESS Explorer](https://github.com/CESSProject/cess-explorer), and [add an account](https://github.com/CESSProject/W3F-illustration/blob/main/gateway/createAccount.PNG).

**Step 2:** Recharge your polka wallet

If you are using the test network, Please join the [CESS discord](https://discord.gg/mYHTMfBwNS) to get it for free. If you are using the official network, please buy CESS tokens.

**Step 3:** Buy space for your account

Browser access: [App](https://testnet-rpc.cess.cloud/explorer) implemented by [CESS Explorer](https://github.com/CESSProject/cess-explorer), and [buy space](https://github.com/CESSProject/W3F-illustration/blob/main/gateway/purchaseSpace.PNG).

**Step 4:** Prepare configuration file

Prepare a configuration file named "conf.toml", put it in the same directory as `gateway`, and its contents are as follows, you need to fill in your own information into the configuration file.
> Our testnet rpc address is: `wss://testnet-rpc.cess.cloud/ws/`
```toml
#The rpc address of the chain node
RpcAddr       = ""
#The ip address that the cess-gateway service listens to
ServiceAddr   = ""
#The port number on which the cess-gateway service listens
ServicePort   = ""
#Phrase or seed of for wallet account
AccountSeed   = ""
#Email address
EmailAddress  = ""
#Email password
EmailPassword = ""
#Outgoing server address of SMTP service
EmailHost     = ""
#Outgoing server port number of SMTP service
EmailHostPort = 0
```

**Step 5:** Start the gateway service

```shell
sudo chmod +x gateway
sudo nohup ./gateway 2>&1 &
```


# Usage for gateway API

The public API endpoint URL of CESS-Gateway is the server you deploy, All endpoints described in this document should be made relative to this root URL.

## Authentication

The CESS-Gateway API uses bearer tokens to authenticate requests. 

Your tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your *secret tokens* in publicly accessible locations such as a GitHub repository, client-side code, and so forth.

The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the `Authorization` header when making requests to protected resources:

| Authorization:"your token" |
| --------------------- |

- Token information

| field           | description                              |
| :-------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| UserId          | User ID                                  |
| CreateUserTime  | The unix time when the user was created  |
| CreateTokenTime | The unix time when the token was created |
| ExpirationTime  | The unix time when token expires         |
| Mailbox         | User's email address                     |
| RandomCode      | Random code                              |

- Token generation

The token is generated by the CESS-Gateway service. Each CESS-Gateway service has its own pair of public and private keys. The public key is used to encrypt the token information, and then base64 is used to encode the ciphertext to obtain the final token.

## Get token

| **POST** /auth |
| -------------- |

The authorization interface is used to generate user tokens.

The user uploads his own email address and a captcha (the captcha should be written as 0 when uploading for the first time). If the email address is not authorized, CESS-Gateway will send a captcha to the mailbox. After the user gets the captcha in the mailbox, upload it again. CESS-Gateway generates a token for it and sends it to the mailbox，the validity of the token is 30 days.

If the mailbox uploaded by the user has been authorized, CESS-Gateway will check whether its token has expired. If it expires, CESS-Gateway will generate a new token and send it to its mailbox.
