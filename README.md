# Service address

* The block explorer address is http://139.224.19.104:3000/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F106.15.44.155%3A9948%2F#/accounts
* The address for free access to tCESS tokens on the testnet is http://47.243.82.77:9708/transfer

# Register a wallet

**Before using, you should refer to the following process to get the token and space**

* First apply for a wallet account in the block explorer, and then buy CESS coins. If it is a test network, you can get it for free.

# Authentication

The CESS-Gateway API uses bearer tokens to authenticate requests. 

Your tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your *secret tokens* in publicly accessible locations such as a GitHub repository, client-side code, and so forth.

The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the `Authorization` header when making requests to protected resources:

| Authorization:"your token" |
| --------------------- |

## token information

| field           | description                              |
| :-------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| UserId          | User ID                                  |
| CreateUserTime  | The unix time when the user was created  |
| CreateTokenTime | The unix time when the token was created |
| ExpirationTime  | The unix time when token expires         |
| Mailbox         | User's email address                     |
| RandomCode      | Random code                              |

## token generation

The token is generated by the CESS-Gateway service. Each CESS-Gateway service has its own pair of public and private keys. The public key is used to encrypt the token information, and then base64 is used to encode the ciphertext to obtain the final token.

# CESS-Gateway HTTP API

The public API endpoint URL of CESS-Gateway is the server you deploy, All endpoints described in this document should be made relative to this root URL.

## User authorization

| **POST** /user/grant |
| -------------------- |

The authorization interface is used to generate user tokens.

The user uploads his own email address and a captcha (the captcha should be written as 0 when uploading for the first time). If the email address is not authorized, CESS-Gateway will send a captcha to the mailbox. After the user gets the captcha in the mailbox, upload it again. CESS-Gateway generates a token for it and sends it to the mailbox，the validity of the token is 30 days.

If the mailbox uploaded by the user has been authorized, CESS-Gateway will check whether its token has expired. If it expires, CESS-Gateway will generate a new token and send it to its mailbox.
